# The-Snake-Game

ABOUT

A simpler version of one of the most popular games of pre-android era built using Turtle package in Python. The game contains a snake which needs to eat 
food by staying within the boundary of the screen. Each time the snake eats food which is generated at random places on the screen, the length of snake
increases and the movement of snake gets faster. If the snake collides with the boundaries of the screen or it's own body the snake dies and the game gets
over.

COMMIT DETAILS

1. "First Commmit" - Pushed the code containing food generation logic at random points and logic related to snake movements and game over.

2. "Second Commit" - Pushed the code updates to add high score tracking functionality. If the current score is greater than current high score, the new
                     high score which is equal to the current score is scored and displayed next time.
                     
3. "Third Commit" - Fixed high score logic which was failing in few scenarios.
